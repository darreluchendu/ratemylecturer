Alright so here's what needs to be done:
   Font Size bigger,

	On home page display add Highest Rated Lecturers and Highest rated Universities,(this mean getting the ratings of all the lecturers of that uni and finding the average lecturer rating between them and then sort them). These list should be side by side and take up width of entire page.,

	Make all forms look as nice as possible (I think login is fine but if u think it can be improved go ahead),

	Make all profile photos the same size,

	Make reviews look better the colours are a bit jarring,

	Decrease size of rating stars,

	Increase size of the percentages thing for lecturers,

	Add date, module, likes, and dislikes to review (I'll handle the liking functionality),

	Make it so that user can change profile picture by clicking profile picture (this may or may not be possible)

	If anyone can think of a better color scheme feel free to change the colors

	Also when I say make something look nicer just look up  templates and examples of that thing and implement it into the site
